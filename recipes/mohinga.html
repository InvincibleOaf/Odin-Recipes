    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mohinga is a classic Burmese dish. It is often eaten for breakfast in Burma/Myanmar, but many people enjoy it for lunch or dinner.
    The dish primarily consists of fish, onions, and garlic cooked with noodles - and the pi√®ce de resistance is <em>ngapi</em> - that is, rotted shrimp paste.
    It's more delicious than it sounds - trust me!
